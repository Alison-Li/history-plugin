# Intelligent History Changelog

## [Unreleased]

Intelligent History is a research prototype plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that aims to support more efficient exploration of
a Java class' commit history by:

1. Highlighting the commit log for a file to distinguish important commits from less important commits;
2. Extracting referenced Jira issue keys from commit messages and providing the Jira issue information directly in IntelliJ.
